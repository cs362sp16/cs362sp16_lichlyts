I only tried a few mutants, and surprisingly all the mutants I tried succeeded. But I could see running hundreds of mutants would be incredibly useful. I tried to automate the process of creating mutants but couldnâ€™t get it to work.

To generate mutants I copied in mutate.py from https://github.com/arun-babu/mutate.py and modified my make file to create a testmutantdominion.out. It can be created by running the following commands:
	$ python mutate.py dominion.c mutantdominion.c
	$ make testmutantdominion.out
