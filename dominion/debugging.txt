A good example of debugging I came across while specifically testing the Dominion code was when my test cases failed for very large numbers of players. I assumed this would work. This could be Agan’s rule #7 or even #1, #7 is about assumptions, but I didn’t read the entire codebase (which is about equivalent to the manual since there wasn’t really one) which would be rule #1. I wrote a test case to build a game with a large number of players and it failed. I then started looking for why. By doing some digging into how each game is setup I found out there is a MAX_PLAYERS macro which is set to 4, which explains why my large number of players (way more than 4) failed.
