Most of my test cases were successful which wasn’t too surprising as I used dominion.c to help write my test cases, I mostly checked for what the successful return value was. All-in-all this isn’t a good testing practice, I should check for more changed values (which I did, but probably not as much as I should have). I did have a few surprising cases such as the edge case for a very large number of players, I assumed that would work but it didn’t. Also buyCard() didn’t work as expected.

As far as gcov is concerned, I achieved ~20% code coverage for dominion.c which I guess is about right, I tested 4 cards and 4 functions which by ballpark is probably about 20% of the total functionality of dominion.c. The way I tested it, I didn’t call hardly any function other than the one I was testing except I always called initializeGame(), which was mostly required. If I wanted to achieve a higher code coverage, I could simulate a round or so and then check if the functions did what they were supposed to.
